## Portfolio Prep
In your first few days of Code 301, you will build a personal portfolio site. This will help you establish a home on the web, and show off some of your software development projects and skills.

Sometimes, the hardest part is getting the words right. To help you prepare for building your portfolio, you can start thinking about what you want to say now.

## Tell me about yourself

Visitors to your portfolio site want to learn about you, in memorable, bite-sized bits. Your page will have a space for you to fill in each of the following descriptions of yourself:

1. A two or three word catchy title. Do NOT use cliches like “programming ninja” or “coding rockstar”

- Code Crafter

2. A personal headline, like you have atop your LinkedIn page. What do you want your career to be about?

Experienced Project Manager with a demonstrated history of working in the building materials industry. Skilled in Logistics Management, Project Management, Customer Service, and Teaching. Strong program and project management professional with a POST Certification focused in Homeland Security, Law Enforcement, Firefighting and Related Protective Services from Knox County Regional Law Enforcement Academy.

3. Your professional pitch: You’ve done a recording, so just write down here how it goes.

- Hello, I am Hayden Cooper. us military veteran who is working toward a transitioning career with a company that is seeking hard-working, goal-oriented, and driven individuals. With me, you will gain experienced individuals with a vast background that allows me to be very adaptable to all projects. I have experience ranging from law enforcement and military to construction project management. My past allows having discipline, accountability, and time management skills others will not posses.

4. What excites you the most about tech? Write 1-2 sentences.
